Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a sarcasm detection project using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to classify text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic, leveraging datasets, preprocessing techniques, and various machine learning or deep learning models.

Features
Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction).
Implementation of traditional machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).
Implementation of deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT).
Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.
Visualizations for dataset analysis and model performance.
